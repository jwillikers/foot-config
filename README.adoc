== Tips and Tricks

=== SSH

When using foot to SSH into another machine, the remote machine needs to have the `foot-terminfo` package installed.
Without this package, things won't behave as expected.
To install it on an `rpm-ostree` system, follow the steps below.

. Install the `foot-terminfo` package.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install foot-terminfo
----

. Reboot to apply the changes.
